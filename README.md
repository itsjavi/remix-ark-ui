## Development

Run the Vite dev server:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

Linting and formatting:

```sh
pnpm run lint

pnpm run format
# or:
pnpm run lint-fix
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
pnpm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
pnpm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `pnpm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`
